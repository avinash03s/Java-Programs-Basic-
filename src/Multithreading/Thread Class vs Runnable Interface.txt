Thread Class                                    vs             Runnable Interface

*1)In case of Thread class When we                     *1)In case of implements Runnable not give Thread or Thread obj directly to
extends Thread Class we get directly                   start Thread, we need to create Thread Constructor and then
Thread or Thread Object;                                pass the Runnable reference in to the Thread Constructor. and then
                                                        give Thread after calling start();

2)Not Possible                                          2)Possible to implements more interfaces;
